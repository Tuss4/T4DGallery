PHP/MySQL Image gallery script.

A very rudimentary PHP/MySQL Image gallery script. 

Installation:

Once you've created your database, run createtables.php. 
If the tables are successfully created, go ahead and delete createtables.php.
Make sure you create an "upload" folder wherever you upload this script.
